Missions will check a countable stat and will be completed when you get to the specified limit
Missions will be differentiated by family and they will depend on previous ones
Each family will give some kind of upgrade


Ideas:
    Clearing X number of cells
    Clearing X number of rows
    Clearing X number of tables

    Clearing same number pairs (mission family for each pair, each one will upgrade a number)
    Clearing sum 10s

    Getting to certain high scores
    Getting to certain TOTAL amount of money
    Getting to certain amount of money in a run
